You haven't mastered React unless you know these essential React coding patterns.

Here’s your guide to 10 patterns every React dev should know:

 1. Compound Component Pattern
- This allows components to work together seamlessly by sharing internal state while keeping flexibility in their usage.
- Use when designing reusable components like dropdowns or modals.
- Example Use Case: A `<Dropdown>` component where `<Dropdown.Button>` and `<Dropdown.Menu>` work together.

 2. Render Prop Pattern
- Provides a function to control what gets rendered, giving more flexibility to components.
- Use when components need to share reusable logic without creating dependencies.
- Example Use Case: A `<DataFetcher>` component that uses a render prop to handle fetched data dynamically.

 3. Higher-Order Component (HOC)
- A function that takes a component and returns a new component with added functionality.
- Use when adding shared behavior like authentication or logging.
- Example Use Case: Wrapping a component with `withAuth` HOC to add user authentication logic.

 4. Controlled Component
- State is controlled via React rather than native DOM inputs.
- Use for forms where you need to maintain real-time state updates.
- Example Use Case: `<input>` components where value updates are synced with React state.

 5. Custom Hook
- Encapsulates reusable logic for components using React’s hooks API.
- Use to avoid duplicating logic across multiple components.
- Example Use Case: A `useFetch` hook for reusable API calls.

 6. Context API
- Provides a way to pass data through the component tree without using props.
- Use for global state management when Redux is overkill.
- Example Use Case: A theme provider for managing light/dark mode across the app.

 7. Error Boundary
- A component designed to catch JavaScript errors and display fallback UI instead of crashing the app.
- Use to handle runtime errors gracefully.
- Example Use Case: Wrapping your entire app with an `<ErrorBoundary>`.

 8. Lazy Loading with Suspense
- Dynamically loads components only when needed, reducing initial load time.
- Use for optimizing large apps with many components.
- Example Use Case: Dynamically loading a heavy `<Chart>` component only when it's visible.

 9. Portals
- Renders components outside of their parent DOM hierarchy.
- Use for modals, tooltips, or dropdowns.
- Example Use Case: A `<Modal>` component rendered at the root of the DOM tree for accessibility.

 10. Reducer Pattern
- Manages complex state transitions using `useReducer` for better readability.
- Use for components with intricate state logic.
- Example Use Case: Managing a multi-step form wizard's state.

These patterns can significantly help you level up, start implementing them, and see the difference they make in your code!

𝟵𝟬% 𝗼𝗳 𝗙𝗿𝗼𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗻𝗱 𝗗𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗙𝗮𝗶𝗹 𝗧𝗵𝗶𝘀 𝗢𝗻𝗲 𝗤𝘂𝗲𝘀𝘁𝗶𝗼𝗻.

• You know React inside and out.
• You've built countless components.
• Your portfolio looks impressive.

𝗕𝘂𝘁 𝘁𝗵𝗲𝗻 𝘁𝗵𝗲 𝗶𝗻𝘁𝗲𝗿𝘃𝗶𝗲𝘄𝗲𝗿 𝗮𝘀𝗸𝘀:
"How would you architect a frontend system that handles real-time collaboration for 10,000+ concurrent users while maintaining 60fps performance?"

 𝗦𝗼𝘂𝗻𝗱 𝗳𝗮𝗺𝗶𝗹𝗶𝗮𝗿?

Most developers freeze because they've never moved beyond tutorial-level thinking.
The gap isn't technical skills—it's systems thinking.

𝗛𝗲𝗿𝗲'𝘀 𝘄𝗵𝗮𝘁 𝘀𝗲𝗽𝗮𝗿𝗮𝘁𝗲𝘀 𝗷𝘂𝗻𝗶𝗼𝗿 𝗱𝗲𝘃𝗲𝗹𝗼𝗽𝗲𝗿𝘀 𝗳𝗿𝗼𝗺 𝘀𝗲𝗻𝗶𝗼𝗿 𝗲𝗻𝗴𝗶𝗻𝗲𝗲𝗿𝘀:
𝗜𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗱 𝗼𝗳: "I know React hooks" They ask: "How do you prevent memory leaks in long-running applications?"
𝗜𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗱 𝗼𝗳:  "I can build components" They ask: "How do you design a component library that works across multiple frameworks?"
𝗜𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗱 𝗼𝗳:  "I use state management" They ask: "How do you handle state synchronization across browser tabs?"
𝗜𝗻𝘀𝘁𝗲𝗮𝗱 𝗼𝗳:  "I know CSS" They ask: "How do you implement smooth animations while maintaining 60fps on low-end devices?"

𝗧𝗵𝗲 𝗯𝗿𝘂𝘁𝗮𝗹 𝘁𝗿𝘂𝘁𝗵: Senior engineers don't just write code—they architect systems.

They think about: 
→ Scale and performance bottlenecks
→ Cross-team collaboration patterns
→ Offline-first architectures
→ Real-time data synchronization
→ Memory management at scale

This mindset shift is worth $50K+ in salary.
• Stop memorizing syntax.
• Start thinking like a systems architect.
