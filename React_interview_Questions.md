You haven't mastered React unless you know these essential React coding patterns.

Here’s your guide to 10 patterns every React dev should know:

 1. Compound Component Pattern
- This allows components to work together seamlessly by sharing internal state while keeping flexibility in their usage.
- Use when designing reusable components like dropdowns or modals.
- Example Use Case: A `<Dropdown>` component where `<Dropdown.Button>` and `<Dropdown.Menu>` work together.

 2. Render Prop Pattern
- Provides a function to control what gets rendered, giving more flexibility to components.
- Use when components need to share reusable logic without creating dependencies.
- Example Use Case: A `<DataFetcher>` component that uses a render prop to handle fetched data dynamically.

 3. Higher-Order Component (HOC)
- A function that takes a component and returns a new component with added functionality.
- Use when adding shared behavior like authentication or logging.
- Example Use Case: Wrapping a component with `withAuth` HOC to add user authentication logic.

 4. Controlled Component
- State is controlled via React rather than native DOM inputs.
- Use for forms where you need to maintain real-time state updates.
- Example Use Case: `<input>` components where value updates are synced with React state.

 5. Custom Hook
- Encapsulates reusable logic for components using React’s hooks API.
- Use to avoid duplicating logic across multiple components.
- Example Use Case: A `useFetch` hook for reusable API calls.

 6. Context API
- Provides a way to pass data through the component tree without using props.
- Use for global state management when Redux is overkill.
- Example Use Case: A theme provider for managing light/dark mode across the app.

 7. Error Boundary
- A component designed to catch JavaScript errors and display fallback UI instead of crashing the app.
- Use to handle runtime errors gracefully.
- Example Use Case: Wrapping your entire app with an `<ErrorBoundary>`.

 8. Lazy Loading with Suspense
- Dynamically loads components only when needed, reducing initial load time.
- Use for optimizing large apps with many components.
- Example Use Case: Dynamically loading a heavy `<Chart>` component only when it's visible.

 9. Portals
- Renders components outside of their parent DOM hierarchy.
- Use for modals, tooltips, or dropdowns.
- Example Use Case: A `<Modal>` component rendered at the root of the DOM tree for accessibility.

 10. Reducer Pattern
- Manages complex state transitions using `useReducer` for better readability.
- Use for components with intricate state logic.
- Example Use Case: Managing a multi-step form wizard's state.

These patterns can significantly help you level up, start implementing them, and see the difference they make in your code!
