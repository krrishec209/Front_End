💯 Master the Art of Optimizing API Calls in React: Build Faster Apps!

When working with APIs in React, one of the biggest performance killers is unoptimized API calls. Let’s fix that with this ultimate guide!


✅ 1. Use useEffect Smartly

Don’t trigger API calls on every render!

useEffect(() => {
 fetchData();
}, []); // Only once on component mount


✅ 2. Debounce Search Inputs

Avoid making calls on every keystroke.

import { debounce } from "lodash";

const handleSearch = debounce((query) => {
 fetch(`api/search?q=${query}`);
}, 500);


✅ 3. Use AbortController to Cancel Requests

Prevent memory leaks and race conditions.

const controller = new AbortController();
fetch(url, { signal: controller.signal });

// On cleanup
controller.abort();


✅ 4. Memoize Expensive Calls

Prevent re-fetching when dependencies haven’t changed.

const data = useMemo(() => fetchData(), [dependency]);


✅ 5. Use React Query, SWR, or TanStack Query

These libraries handle caching, refetching, background updates, and error handling like a pro.

const { data, isLoading } = useQuery('users', fetchUsers);


✅ 6. Paginate & Lazy Load

Fetch only what’s needed.

/api/posts?page=1&limit=10


✅ 7. Cache Responses

Use localStorage, sessionStorage, or advanced caching with SWR/React Query.

localStorage.setItem("user", JSON.stringify(data));


✅ 8. Combine Multiple Requests (If Applicable)

Instead of multiple calls, ask your backend team to support batch API endpoints.
